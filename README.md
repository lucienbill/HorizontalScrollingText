# HorizontalScrollingText
Do you watch the news?
Picture the text on the lower portion of the screen : some "flash news" scroll all the time.
I wanted to have that on my live stream on Twitch, so I codded this simple thing.

## How to use it in OBS?
Just include it as a browser source.

Change the speed, the text, the style however you like.

Here is a heavily compressed gif to show how I do it:
